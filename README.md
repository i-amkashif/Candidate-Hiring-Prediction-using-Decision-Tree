Candidate Hiring Prediction using Decision Tree.

In this project, we build a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a candinate applying for a job at a company would get hired or not. we build two models, one with criterion gini index and another one with criterion entropy.We implement Decision Tree Classification with Python and Scikit-Learn. We have used the PastHires dataset for this project, downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.

Dataset have 7 columns, Years Experience, Employed? Previous employers, Level of Education, Top-tier school, Interned, and Hired.

Model will predict whether the candidate would get hired by company based on the attributes of the candidate who gets hired or does not get hired from the past.

GUI is created with Python Tkinter which can give prediction for candidate individual's attrubute values.


For generation Decision Tree, import module pydotplus.

$pip install pydotplus
